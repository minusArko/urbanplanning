                Mahmoud Yousef explores what climate change is, and how it affects our cities and daily lives. Yousef highlights climate change as a phenomenon  that is either directly, or indirectly caused by human activity, thus contributing to the alteration of the global atmosphere. In addition Yousef also discusses the various strategies to deal with climate change. While the methods he mentions such as mitigation and adaptation are not directly related to urban planning, they are complementary in addressing the issues caused by climate change. Yousef also examines the social aspects and challenges that certain developing countries may face when planning for climate change, often due to a lack of economics and resources.

                In this article, Sara Meerow explores the nature, and interconnectedness of politics and urban planning. Meerow started by Hurricane Harvey’s devastating impact on Houston as a result of lack of climate adaptation and urban planning. Meerow highlights the intersection of local, regional, and national politics in the urban planning process, and that urban planners are reliant on politicians’ support for their plans. The author references the Trump administration’s decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement as an example of this. Meerow also delves into the phenomenon of justice in urban adaptation planning, where wealthier municipal governments have more resources for adaptation planning than developing, or underdeveloped governments.

                Brian Stone, Jason Vargo, and Dana Habeeb delve into the phenomenon of climate change and its effects in various cities in the United States. The authors analyze the fifty of the most populous U.S metropolitan areas in the United States, and their climate data for the past several decades and conclude a general increase in temperatures over the past few decades. Moreover, they also examine the effectiveness of climate action plans in these cities in response to rapid change in temperatures. The methods that the authors found to be most effective included methods such as tree planting and high albedo roofs.

                Robert D. Brown, Jennifer Vanos, Natasha Kenny, and Sanda Lenzholzer highlight human health risks due to increased frequencies of heat waves as a result of climate change. The authors emphasize the crucial role of park design in urban areas as a method of mitigating the effects of rising temperatures. As such, they chose several urban locations across the globe from the likes of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and Toronto, Canada. The authors made various observations in these cities along with a human energy budget model to assess the impacts, and importance of urban parks in reducing the effects of climate change.

            <p class="paragraph">
                In this article, Yaman examines several strategies in designing energy efficient buildings. Yaman starts by explaining the general cause of a building to be energy inefficient as a result of heat loss through improperly insulated buildings and walls. Different types of climates call for different design strategies, and as such, Yamn delves into building strategies that various climates may employ for more energy efficient buildings. Notable strategies include controlled ventilation and plant integration.

                The article looks at climate adaptation plans in small and mid-sized urban communities in France and the United States and finds that French plans are more consistent and influenced by national and EU-level planning. The study points out the importance of better guidelines and engaging methods. French plans do well in using metrics, but American plans show variation and less involvement due to various goals and a lack of federal policies. Regular monitoring, user-friendly climatic data, and continual review and revision are critical components of successful adaptation planning.

                The article demonstrates how Aksu City in Northwestern China is a great example of arid urban planning. The case study shows the importance of sustainable urban planning in dry regions confronted with urbanization and climate change challenges. The study looks at the relationship between land surface temperature and the content and design of urban green spaces using Landsat data with a resolution of 30m. The findings support current attempts in sustainable urban development, particularly in dry regions where urbanization and climate change are particularly severe.

                This article shows the impact of growing cities on regional climate and potential for urban planning to reduce these impacts. In the study, urban expansion in the United States causes warming over vast regional swathes of the country, resulting in quite a bit of the expected temperature rises due to greenhouse gas emissions. Green and cool roofs, on the other hand, clash with urban-induced warming, and adaptation methods can reduce urban-induced warming. The article highlights the importance of properly including urban expansion in order to build regionally relevant adaptation techniques.

                The article talks about the growing popularity of high-speed rail (HSR) and its effects on urban and regional development. It questions present ways to measure accessibility, focused on rail frequency and destination mass. The authors show a more detailed potential-based method that takes into account train frequency and area, to provide more knowledge of everyday accessibility. The study, which took place in the Shandong Province in China, shows the success of the new strategy in maximizing the impact of HSR on regional development.

                The article talks about the importance of environmental planning in the early stages of new urban planning in Iraq, specifically Samawah New City. Prior master plans for Iraqi cities, it says, did not effectively address environmental challenges, resulting in conflicts between approved projects and environmental systems. To reduce such issues, the article suggests taking environmental considerations early in the development process. The study uses a descriptive analysis and inductive approach to explain the environmental dimension in the early stages of new city design in Iraq. The study follows the United Nations' definition of sustainability from 1987, focusing on sustainable urban planning solutions such as green buildings, mixed-use structures, renewable energy sources, and sustainable land use planning. The Samawah New City case study shows the importance of environmental planning in the decision-making and implementation stages.
